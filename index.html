                <p>As a Frontend Developer with 8 years of experience, I draw inspiration for work from team. I believe that with the right attitude, nothing is impossible.
                    Beyond standard frontend development tasks, I have had the opportunity to support the work of testers, backend developers,
                    and sysadmins to collectively achieve our goals. In my free time, I dance and play board games.

                            <p class="comment-text">I’ve co-operated with Robert for a year in a remote software team for a big automotive client. Robert worked in the role of a frontend developer and I was the QA lead.

                                When working with Robert I felt that my time is respected: the tickets he delivers are carefully checked against the requirements and he is open to discuss any QA feedback. Instead of trying to protect his individual solution, he listens to suggestions and looks for common agreement. At the same time, he is conscious of client needs and takes into consideration the time needed to apply proposed changes, rather than agreeing to any idea that is thrown at him.

                                In our team there was a QA intern who has just started working in the field. It was a pleasure to see how good of a coach Robert was to this colleague. I felt completely safe to let them co-operate without any supervision, as he would not teach her any bad practice. Apart from that, I myself could always reach out with any tech questions, including those that were not linked to his own task.

                                Finally, I would like to add that Robert has good communication skills. He updates the team properly and speaks his mind openly, which is important when working remotely. He is also a good colleague, caring for good atmosphere in the team.

                            </p>

                            <p class="comment-text">Robert is a highly motivated developer seeking for learning new
                                skills and always fighting for perfection. Out of many things I could say, I believe the
                                most important to be raised is his incredible ability to listen and
                                to be open minded. It has been a pleasure to work side by side with Robert, share
                                knowledge with him and see him growing on a daily basis in the context of the many
                                projects we've cooperated. Have I mentioned social/soft
                                skills? Those are a strong point as well. Robert knows how to work in a team,
                                understands and has an Agile mindset, and also knows how to make a good joke!

                                delivered is what makes Robert very valuable member of development team. He impressed me
                                with the speed he is collecting new skills and that he was open
                                to whatever is needed to help his team achieve the goal and it wasn’t limited to coding,
                                but also supporting QA Team or Business Analyst. Robert has a great potential that will
                                make him not a good developer, but a great
                                one.

                        <p class="comment-text">I’ve co-operated with Robert for a year in a remote software team for a big automotive client. Robert worked in the role of a frontend developer and I was the QA lead.

                            When working with Robert I felt that my time is respected: the tickets he delivers are carefully checked against the requirements and he is open to discuss any QA feedback. Instead of trying to protect his individual solution, he listens to suggestions and looks for common agreement. At the same time, he is conscious of client needs and takes into consideration the time needed to apply proposed changes, rather than agreeing to any idea that is thrown at him.

                            In our team there was a QA intern who has just started working in the field. It was a pleasure to see how good of a coach Robert was to this colleague. I felt completely safe to let them co-operate without any supervision, as he would not teach her any bad practice. Apart from that, I myself could always reach out with any tech questions, including those that were not linked to his own task.

                            Finally, I would like to add that Robert has good communication skills. He updates the team properly and speaks his mind openly, which is important when working remotely. He is also a good colleague, caring for good atmosphere in the team.

                        <p class="comment-text">Robert is a highly motivated developer seeking for learning new
                            skills and always fighting for perfection. Out of many things I could say, I believe the
                            most important to be raised is his incredible ability to listen and
                            to be open minded. It has been a pleasure to work side by side with Robert, share
                            knowledge with him and see him growing on a daily basis in the context of the many
                            projects we've cooperated. Have I mentioned social/soft
                            skills? Those are a strong point as well. Robert knows how to work in a team,
                            understands and has an Agile mindset, and also knows how to make a good joke!

                            delivered is what makes Robert very valuable member of development team. He impressed me
                            with the speed he is collecting new skills and that he was open
                            to whatever is needed to help his team achieve the goal and it wasn’t limited to coding,
                            but also supporting QA Team or Business Analyst. Robert has a great potential that will
                            make him not a good developer, but a great
                            one.
